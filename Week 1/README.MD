| bank_mechanism.sol    | A simple implementation of a Bank Mechanism.        |
| voting_system.sol     | A basic Voting System implementation.               |

## Bank Mechanism

### Description

The `bank_mechanism.sol` file contains a simple Solidity smart contract that simulates a bank mechanism. Users can create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and transfer funds between accounts.

### Usage
