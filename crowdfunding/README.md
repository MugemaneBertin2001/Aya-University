# Crowdfunding Smart Contract using Hardhat

This project demonstrates a basic crowdfunding smart contract built using Solidity and tested using Hardhat's development environment.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Ethereum smart contract that implements a crowdfunding campaign. The contract allows participants to contribute funds to the campaign, and the contract owner can withdraw funds if the campaign's goal is reached within a specified timeframe.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd crowdfunding
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Compile the smart contract:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contract:

   Modify the `scripts/deploy.js` file to customize deployment parameters if needed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

   Replace `<network_name>` with the desired network, such as `rinkeby` or `localhost`.

4. Interact with the smart contract:

   Use the Hardhat console to interact with the deployed contract:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat console --network <network_name>
   ```

   ```javascript
   const Crowdfunding = await ethers.getContractFactory("Crowdfunding");
   const crowdfunding = await Crowdfunding.attach("<deployed_contract_address>");

   await crowdfunding.contribute({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1") });
   const balance = await crowdfunding.getBalance();
   console.log("Contract balance:", ethers.utils.formatEther(balance));
   ```

## Customization

- Modify the smart contract in the `contracts` directory (`Crowdfunding.sol`) to add more features or functionality.
- Customize deployment parameters and testing scenarios as needed.
